\usage{
count_bycol(prot = prot, column = "DomArch", min.freq = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{prot}{A data frame containing the dataset to analyze, typically with
multiple columns including the one specified by the \code{column} parameter.}

\item{column}{A character string specifying the name of the column to analyze.
The default is "DomArch".}

\item{min.freq}{An integer specifying the minimum frequency an element must
have to be included in the output. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{column}}{The unique elements from the specified column
(e.g., "DomArch").}
\item{\code{freq}}{The frequency of each element, i.e., the number of times
each element appears in the specified column.}
}
The tibble is filtered to only include elements that have a frequency
greater than or equal to \code{min.freq} and does not include elements with \code{NA}
values or those starting with a hyphen ("-").
